# Correlating factors in regard to abortion in Ireland and Malta
I used the data set from the European Election Study 2009 and re-did my seminar paper in Python (instead of Stata). The paper include univariate and bivariate analyses. Gender partially, opnion on female employment and level of spirituality correlated with the attitude on abortion.
