# Cough for the World

Tools to detect respiratory diseases such as asthma but also possibly for Covid-19 are needed. The goal of the tool is to advice to go to a doctor or to tell the participants that their status is unknown and they still may need medical advice. This could help to increase awareness for individuals who might not consider their coughing as a serious sign. 

As a team we developed a survey and a platform where participants and doctors can upload a recording of their coughing. Once we have enough data, we can feed it to our ML model which we have also already built. It transforms the data from a time into a frequency space and uses the resulting spectrum to find correlations between the data. As soon as there is enough data, we can train our ML model. And further develop for people to have their coughs analysed.

Presentation of the finished project can be viewed on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/n_ywYdjZJLI)
